## Code Contributions

The ten minimum requirements for code contributions are:

1. All Pull Requests _must_ be based off the `develop` branch.
2. The code _must_ be compliant with the configured ESLint rules based on the [JS Standard Code Style](http://standardjs.com).
3. All PRs _should_ have a dedicated scope (e.g. not mixing code refactorings with delivering a new feature) and reasonable size.
4. All new and changed code _should_ have a corresponding unit and/or integration test.
5. New and changed challenges _must_ have a corresponding e2e test.
6. Noise (e.g. unnecessary comments) generated by AI tools _must_ be removed before opening a PR.
7. All [status checks](https://pwning.owasp-juice.shop/companion-guide/latest/part3/contribution.html#_continuous_integration_deployment) _must_ pass for the last commit within your PR.
8. All Git commits within a PR _must_ be [signed off](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit#Documentation/git-commit.txt--s) to indicate the contributor's agreement with the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/).
9. [Cintributing to translations](https://pwning.owasp-juice.shop/companion-guide/latest/part3/translation.html) _should_ be done via [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/owasp-juice-shop) and _not_ via GitHub PRs.
10. Particularly low-effort contributions (e.g. incomplete typo fixes in a single file, trivial text changes, code formatting) or any forms of potential "contribution farming" _must not_ be submitted as PRs. Doing so more than once _might_ be [considered spamming and handled accordingly](https://pwning.owasp-juice.shop/companion-guide/latest/part3/contribution.html#_handling_of_spam_prs).
