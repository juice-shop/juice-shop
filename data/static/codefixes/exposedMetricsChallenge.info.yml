fixes:
  - id: 1
    explanation: "This fix prevents unauthorized access to the metrics route but overshoots the goal by locking out everyone - including administrators."
  - id: 2
    explanation: "The metrics route remains publicly accessible. This change only messes with functional settings of the measurement framework unnecessarily."
  - id: 3
    explanation: "Access will now be restricted only to users with administrator permissions, which seems reasonable protection, assuming that it is not possible for a reegular user to escalate admin priviliges. If that were a risk, the metrics should better be stored behind the scenes not be made accessible via the shop application at all."
hints:
  - "Can you find a HTTP route mapping that deals with metrics?"
  - "Remember: The default behavior of route mappings is to allow access to everyone."
