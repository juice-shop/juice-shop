    explanation: 'This contract is actually secure in its implementation. The vulnerability for this challenge is not in the smart contract code itself, but in how the wallet seed phrase was exposed.'
  - id: 2
    explanation: 'Correct! This challenge is about sensitive data exposure (the wallet seed phrase), not a smart contract vulnerability. The contract code is the same because the issue is operational security, not code security.'
  - id: 3
    explanation: 'The contract implementation is secure. The Soul Bound Token (SBT) correctly prevents transfers after minting. The challenge vulnerability is the exposed seed phrase, not the contract code.'
  - id: 4
    explanation: 'The contract is properly implemented. This challenge focuses on finding accidentally posted credentials (seed phrase), which is a different type of security issue than smart contract vulnerabilities.'
hints:
  - 'This challenge is about sensitive data exposure, not a smart contract coding flaw.'
  - 'The seed phrase for the wallet was accidentally posted somewhere. Look for it in the application.'
  - 'Once you have the seed phrase, you can import the wallet and access the Soul Bound Token (NFT).'
