# Security Policy

OWASP Juice Shop is an _intentionally vulnerable_ web application, but
we still do not want to be suprised by zero day vulnerabilities which
are not part of our hacking challenges. We are following the proposed
Internet standard <https://securitytxt.org> so you can find our
"security" policy in any running instance of the application at the
expected location described in
<https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-foudil-securitytxt-06>. Finding it is
actually one of our hacking challenges!

## Supported Versions

We provide security patches for the latest released minor version.

| Version | Supported          |
|:--------|:-------------------|
| 9.2.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| <9.2    | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

For vulnerabilities which are **not** part of any hacking challenge
please contact <bjoern.kimminich@owasp.org>. In all other cases please
contact our shop's "security team" at the address mentioned in our
`security.txt` file.

> Instead of fixing reported vulnerabilities we might turn them into
> hacking challenges! You might receive a reward for reporting a
> vulnerability that makes it into one of our challenges!
