Inspired by the \"classic\" [BodgeIt Store](https://code.google.com/p/bodgeit/) by [@psiinon](https://github.com/psiinon).\r\n\r\n> Translating \"dump\" or \"useless outfit\" into German yields \"Saftladen\" which can be reverse-translated word by word into \"juice shop\". Hence the name of this project.\r\n    \r\nYou may find it easier to find vulnerabilities using a pen test tool. I strongly recommend [Zed Attack Proxy](https://code.google.com/p/zaproxy/) which is open source and very powerful, yet beginner friendly.\r\n \r\n## Features\r\n\r\n- Easy to install: Just requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org)\r\n- Self contained: Additional dependencies will be resolved and downloaded automatically\r\n- No external DB:  A simple file based SQLite database is used which is wiped and regenerated on server startup\r\n- Open source: No hidden costs or caveats\r\n \r\n## Getting started\r\n\r\n### From Sources\r\n\r\n1. Install [node.js](http://nodejs.org) (version 0.10.x)\r\n2. Run ```git clone https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop.git``` (or clone [your own fork](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop/fork) of the repository) \r\n3. Run ```npm install``` (only has to be done before first start or when you change the source code)\r\n4. Run ```npm start```\r\n5. Browse to <http://localhost:3000>\r\n\r\n### Docker Container\r\n\r\n1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com)\r\n2. Run ```docker pull bkimminich/juice-shop```\r\n3. Run ```docker run -d -p 3000:3000 bkimminich/juice-shop```\r\n4. Browse to <http://localhost:3000> \r\n\r\n### Packaged Distribution\r\n\r\n1. Install [node.js](http://nodejs.org) (version 0.10.x)\r\n2. Download ```juice-shop-<version>.zip``` attached to [latest release](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop/releases/latest)\r\n3. Unpack and run ```npm start``` in unzipped folder\r\n4. Browse to <http://localhost:3000>\r\n\r\n## Troubleshooting\r\n\r\n- If you are experiencing [Error 128](https://github.com/bower/bower/issues/50) from some GitHub repos during ```bower_install.js``` execution, run ```git config --global url.\"https://\".insteadOf git://``` and try ```npm install``` again\r\n- If using Boot2Docker (Docker inside VirtualBox on Windows) make sure that you also enable port forwarding from Host ```127.0.0.1:3000``` to ```0.0.0.0:3000``` for TCP \r\n- If ```npm install``` fails after an update of your local copy during ```bower_install.js``` complaining about version issues, delete ```/app/bower_components``` and try again to remove outdated versions that cause conflicts","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
