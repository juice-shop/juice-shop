OWASP Juice Shop is probably the most modern and sophisticated insecure web application! It can be used in security
trainings, awareness demos, CTFs and as a guinea pig for security tools! Juice Shop encompasses vulnerabilities from the
entire
[OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten) along with many other security flaws found in real-world
applications!

## Setup

> You can find some less common installation variations in
> [the _Running OWASP Juice Shop_ documentation](https://pwning.owasp-juice.shop/part1/running.html).

### Deploy on Heroku (free ($0/month) dyno)

1. [Sign up to Heroku](https://signup.heroku.com/) and
   [log in to your account](https://id.heroku.com/login)
2. Click the button below and follow the instructions

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

> This is the quickest way to get a running instance of Juice Shop! If
> you have forked this repository, the deploy button will automatically
> pick up your fork for deployment! As long as you do not perform any
> DDoS attacks you are free to use any tools or scripts to hack your
> Juice Shop instance on Heroku!

### From Sources

   [Azure CLI](https://azure.github.io/projects/clis/) **or** login to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com),
   open the _CloudShell_
   and then choose _Bash_ (not PowerShell).
2. Create a resource group by running `az group create --name <group name> --location <location name, e.g. "centralus">`
3. Create a new container by
   running `az container create --resource-group <group name> --name <container name> --image bkimminich/juice-shop --dns-name-label <dns name label> --ports 3000 --ip-address public`
4. Your container will be available at `http://<dns name label>.<location name>.azurecontainer.io:3000`

### Google Compute Engine Instance

1. Login to the Google Cloud Console and
   [open Cloud Shell](https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard?cloudshell=true).
2. Launch a new GCE instance based on the juice-shop container. Take note of the `EXTERNAL_IP` provided in the output.

```
gcloud compute instances create-with-container owasp-juice-shop-app --container-image bkimminich/juice-shop
```

3. Create a firewall rule that allows inbound traffic to port 3000

```
gcloud compute firewall-rules create juice-rule --allow tcp:3000
```

4. Your container is now running and available at
   `http://<EXTERNAL_IP>:3000/`
