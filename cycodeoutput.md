1. Used existing OWASP Juice Shop application
2. Forked the project in Github
3. git clone https://github.com/JAER12392/juice-shop.git
4. cd juice-shop-master & run npm install to ensure dependencies are up to date & run npm start to see it run on your local machine on PORT 3000 - http://localhost:3000
6. a. No code review for catching any bug, possiblity of breaking build, ensuring code quality, makes it difficult to work on differen features and fixes since the main copy has already been broken.
   b. BRANCH PROTECTION!!!!
